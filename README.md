# Introduction:
Intro to JS is not as easy to grasp as it was with SDF, just when i thought im getting the hang of things ,JS proved me wrong, 
the is a lot of terms to know and learn,Its still early days to can say much about it
# Challenges:
The project was not that hectic , but a bit tricky for me as im still struggling with understanding the language, I had to look for extra reading and teaching materials to get a bit of light, as all at first sounded foreign . Honestly im overwhelmed by it all, I had to take in a lot of content in ,at a very little time and put it into practice, it felt like im doing something that i cant't explain.
# Overall:
Learning new things is not easy  but worth it, difficult as it may look i know i will fully understand as we continue with thhe course.
It is scary and exciting at the same time.
